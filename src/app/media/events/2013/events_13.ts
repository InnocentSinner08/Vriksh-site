      "VRIKSH BE THE CHANGE is a trust based in 2013 in Manpur Patwatoli. The village is famous for producing IIT graduates; however, there are still many underprivileged children who have never got schooling. VRIKSH BE THE CHANGE promises that financial constraints will not come in the way of primary education. The trust reduces school dropouts by providing required support to needy children. <br /><br /> In 2013, Bhola Kumar was the first beneficiary of the trust's initiative. His family was facing a lot of financial stress, and it was difficult for his parents to afford his education expenses. The VRIKSH team approached Bhola's father and assured him of financial assistance to ensure Bhola could continue his schooling. He became the first student supported by VRIKSH BE THE CHANGE, marking the beginning of the trust's journey towards educational empowerment. <br/ ><br/> <b><i>\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\"<i/><b/> â€“ Lao Tzu",
